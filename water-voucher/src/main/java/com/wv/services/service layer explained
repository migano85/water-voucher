SERVICE COMPONENT
-----------------


Service layer is where components annotated with @Service reside.
service layer is the business layer where data retrieved from DB get modified 
and other business requirement are done, before data is given to controller layer or saved to DB.
it is also where any business validation is done.
for simple CRUD project like this one this layer can be omitted.
